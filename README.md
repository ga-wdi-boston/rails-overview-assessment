## Assessment :: Rails Overview

Fork and clone this repository.

### Questions
1. Explain why Rails exists and what it's used for.

Rails is a framework for building websites. As such, Rails establishes conventions for easier collaboration and maintenance. These conventions are codified as the Rails API (the application programming interface, or directives that control the code). The Rails API is documented online and described in books, articles, and blog posts. Learning Rails means learning how to use the Rails conventions and its API.

1. Using a marker, pen, or pencil, sketch the components of an (R)MVC architecture, how they interconnect, and which components have what responsibilities. Take a photo of your drawing and add it to the `submissions` directory inside your clone.
1. Describe the flow of a PATCH request as it goes through the app.

What is PATCH?
The HTTP method PUT means resource creation or replacement at some given URL.

Think files, for example. If you upload a file to S3 at some URL, you want either to create the file at that URL or replace an existing file if there's one. That is PUT.
